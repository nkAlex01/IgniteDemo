	<h2>What is Naturist?</h2>
	<img src="woman-567021_1920.JPG" width="300" height="250" alt=""  class="floatleft">
	<p>The only difference between a professional massage by a trained and qualified therapist and a naturist massage is that the person receiving the massage is not encumbered by any towels, and the person giving the massage is also "equal status". So both are completely at one with them selves, free and natural as the day they were born.</p>
	<p>What is the attraction of a naturist massage? Well if you are already a naturist you will already understand that marvellous feeling, uncluttered, unfettered from clothes, a freedom and at oneness with yourself, your surroundings and other people. In this state you can truly relax.</p>
	<p>From the point of view of giving a naturist massage, there is nothing in the way to stop the sweeping, flowing movements of the massage, so there is a better flow and sychronisation to the whole massage. You simply feel you are giving a better massge because of this and that is rewarding in itself.</p>
